The most influential contributors to this theory are considered to be the 18th and 19th-century British philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, formulated the principle of utility as the 'greatest happiness principle' or the principle of the 'greatest happiness of the greatest number.'",

Rule utilitarianism was proposed later, by thinkers like Richard Brandt and John Rawls, as a way to address some of the problems and criticisms that had been raised against act utilitarianism. The distinction between act and rule utilitarianism is a central debate in normative ethics.",

Utilitarians have responded to these criticisms in various ways. Some have argued that a proper understanding of utility would not lead to the counterintuitive conclusions that critics suggest. Others have modified the theory, for example by incorporating rules or by focusing on preference satisfaction rather than pleasure and pain.",

Kant believed that there are certain actions that are absolutely prohibited, even if they would bring about more happiness than the alternatives. For Kant, the rightness of an action depends not on its consequences but on whether it fulfills our duty. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in several ways, but the most well-known version states that we should 'act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.' This means that an action is morally right if and only if you could rationally will that the maxim (or principle) behind your action should become a universal law that everyone follows.",

However, this theory faces the Euthyphro dilemma: Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good?

These traits derive from natural internal tendencies, but need to be nurtured; however, once established, they will become stable. For Aristotle, virtue is the golden mean between two vices: excess and deficiency. For example, courage is a virtue, while rashness is an excess of courage and cowardice is a deficiency.

To avoid this, individuals agree to a social contract and establish a civil society.

Therefore, individuals agree to a social contract and establish a civil society to protect their natural rights.

From this position, Rawls argues, individuals would agree to principles of justice that are fair to all.

Camus, who is often associated with existentialism despite his rejection of the label, explored existentialist themes in his novels and essays, particularly the concept of the absurd.
